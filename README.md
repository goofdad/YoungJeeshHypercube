# YoungJeeshHypercube
My hypercube project, based on the Parametric HyperQbert at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1873950

## Why?
I loved Tech2C's hypercube, and I love openscad for design. Like anything, though, I wanted to put my own spin on it.

## Modifications
* Added support for LMxLUU
* My 2020 extrusion is using M5 not M4 screws.
* Makefile support to generate all the stl and gcode files from the command line.

## Mods to do
* better tensioner
* belt driven dual z
* anti-backlash nut?
* what else?
