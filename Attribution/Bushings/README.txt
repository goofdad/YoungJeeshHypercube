# Summary

With this customizable design, you are able to create bushings, that will be printed in an optimal way. You can set the inner and outer diameter, the length, the extrusion width, number of perimeters and number of teeth.
You can find a more detailed description above each variable in the MakerBot Customizer or OpenSCAD file.
Please leave a comment, if you have any questions or problems!

####Updates
- 2017-10-02: I still can't recognize any wear to the bushings. I seasoned the bushings a second time with PTFE spray (this time from WD-40), just to be sure.
- 2017-08-15: fixed graphic glitch
- 2017-08-07: added chamfer setting in customizer. There will be a graphic glitch in the preview, but the .stl-File will be generated without any glitch.
- 2017-06-14: After 3 months and 4kg filament, i couldn't recognize any wear to these bushings, printed in PLA. I used one drop PTFE oil per bearing in the beginning and the bushings are still wet. For me, they perform much better, than the IGUS Japan bushings.

# Print Settings

Printer: Anet A8
Resolution: 0.12
Infill: 0%

Notes: 
Extrusion width (not the nozzle size!) and # of perimeters should be in sync between the Customizer / OpenSCAD and your Slicer! Check the 4th picture how it should look like, before printing.

# Post-Printing

Best way in my case is to choose the bushing where you can push it in with some effort on the rod and slide it by hand without any tools. Then slide it back and forth along the rod, until the bushing has the expected behavior. I suggest you not to use any drill or heat. The sliding of the bushing generates enough heat from its friction against the rod.
